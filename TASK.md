# Improve the card search results components

OBBIECTIVE: improve the code disposition of the compact-card-search an aspect of the search results
ROLE: You are a profetional frontend developer and ui designer

Currently there are 2 components that makes basicaly the same work: mobile-card-search and compact-card-search
it shoul be possible to use just once, i don' t like the approach to use document.addEventListener 
it' s not a react best practice. there are also components that i think are not currently in use delete them.

also improve the display of the search results, use a color with more contraxt and no trasparency effect,
use a color variable already in use maybe with som contraxt. make some changes to the search result 
to look more production ready.
